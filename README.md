# UniLu_DMinR
University Luzern FS 23 "Data Mining in R" sandbox for the Capstone Project

The project is meant to be an idea for a "self-care" walk. 
The user would access their Spotify account, choose a playlist, and the project matches the length of their playlist to a restaurant in Lucerne. The starting point is always the University of Lucerne and the route is calculated via walking.

For this, Spotify API, Google Places API and Google Directions API are used.
